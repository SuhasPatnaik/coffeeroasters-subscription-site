        Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of
        harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality
        control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every
        bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is
        to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and
        enjoyable.
